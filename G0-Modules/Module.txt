To add a Go module as a dependency to your project, you can use the go mod command.

First, navigate to the root directory of your Go project in your terminal.
Run the command go mod init to initialize a new Go module in the current directory. This will create a new file called go.mod in your project's root directory.
To add a dependency, use the go get command followed by the import path of the module you want to add. For example, to add the "github.com/gorilla/mux" module, you would run go get github.com/gorilla/mux
Once you have added the dependency, you can use it in your code by importing it like any other Go package.
run go mod tidy to automatically update the go.mod file with the new dependency and any other dependencies it may have.
You can use go mod graph to see the dependencies of your project
You can also specify a specific version of a dependency by adding the version number after the package name like this go get github.com/gorilla/mux@v1.6.2.

Note that, once you have added a dependency, it is locked to a specific version, and further updates to that dependency will not be reflected in your project until you explicitly update it.
