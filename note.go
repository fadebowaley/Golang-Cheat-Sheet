Go is a statically-typed language, which means that the type of a variable must be specified at the time of declaration. Go has several built-in types, including:

** bool: a boolean value (true or false)
** string: a string of characters
** int, int8, int16, int32, int64: signed integers of different sizes
** uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64: unsigned integers of different sizes
** float32, float64: floating-point numbers
** complex64, complex128: complex numbers


 Go also has several built-in composite types, including:

** array: a fixed-size ordered collection of elements
** slice: a dynamic ordered collection of elements
** map: an unordered collection of key-value pairs
** struct: a collection of fields
** interface: a collection of methods

In addition to the built-in types, Go also allows you to define your own types using type keyword.

Go also has several built-in functions and methods that you can use to work with these types, including:

** new: allocates memory for a new value of a given type and returns its address
** make: allocates and initializes a value of a built-in composite type (slice, map, or channel)
** len: returns the number of elements in a built-in composite type (string, array, slice, or map)
** cap: returns the capacity of a built-in composite type (slice or channel)
** append: adds one or more elements to the end of a slice
** copy: copies elements from one slice to another
** delete: deletes a key-value pair from a map
** get: retrieves the value of a key from a map
** range: iterates over the elements of a built-in composite type (string, array, slice, or map)
** close: closes a channel

It is also worth noting that Go has several important keywords and concepts such as:

var: declares a variable

** const: declares a constant
** func: declares a function
** package: declares the package that the code belongs to
** import: imports other packages for use in the code
** struct: declares a struct
** interface: declares an interface
** go: starts a goroutine
** chan: declares a channel
** select: selects a case of a channel operation

This is not an exhaustive list of all the Go methods and usage, but it should give you a good overview of some of the most commonly used ones.\
